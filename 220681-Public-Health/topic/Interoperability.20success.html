<p>The Public Health WG is having a discussion on how to measure the success of interoperability incentive programs (spurred on by a HIMSS blog post (<a href="https://www.himss.org/resources/determining-measures-success-interoperability" target="_blank" title="https://www.himss.org/resources/determining-measures-success-interoperability">https://www.himss.org/resources/determining-measures-success-interoperability</a>)). We’ve set aside some time on the Jan 24th call to further talk about the topic. All are welcome to join.</p>

<p>Points to consider for possible feedback to HIMSS:<br>
• Any assessment of overall interoperability success should include the impact on population health (public health) in addition to the benefits for providers and patients<br>
• Measures should consider both the quantity of messages and the quality of messages<br>
○ Just increasing the number of messages flowing will not be sufficient for maximal impact<br>
§ More messages may not equate to improved experience if it means that more fragmented data is available and requiring reconciliation<br>
§ More complex patterns of data flow (eg. from a provider to an HIE and then on to a public health agency) may complicate data analysis<br>
□ Should a multi-hop exchange count as just a single exchange of data or multiple?<br>
§ Many submitters to public health are still using batch submissions which are still valuable (albeit perhaps not as valuable as real time exchange) but harder to assess<br>
○ The quality of the data is just as (or more) important<br>
§ Quality can include accuracy, timeliness, completeness and standardization<br>
§ Measuring the adoption of standard terminologies could be one way to assess improved quality<br>
§ Proportion of discrete data (coded test results rather than a textual narrative, discrete name components, etc) may also be a useful metric<br>
• A reduction in cost and time to onboard submitters is also a potential metric (with the ability to measure real world impact on public health programs)<br>
• Other reductions in cost are also good indicators of success<br>
○ Does it require fewer resources to data cleanse, deduplicate data, etc?<br>
• Even with public health, there may be significant variation between programs<br>
○ For example, electronic immunization reporting was well established prior to incentive programs but still saw a marked increase in data exchange while electronic case reporting has only developed recently and is not as widely implemented (but getting off the ground is often the hardest part)<br>
• Ultimately, it is the impact on patients, providers and public health programs which should be the true measure of interoperability success<br>
• Some assessment work is already happening in the public health space<br>
○ Societies such as the American Immunization Registry Association (AIRA) may already be capturing data<br>
○ Individual jurisdictions are already looking at assessing data quality in submitted data</p>
