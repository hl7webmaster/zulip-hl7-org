<p>ITS is planning to ballot FHIRPath as normative in May. There's several implementations in different languages by different authors, there's plenty of use in the FHIR spec, there's a solid set of tests. There's some production use. And there's been very little substantiative change</p>
<p>This is a call for comments and consideration on making this normative. In particular, has anyone used the v2 part (other than me?)</p>

<p>Does it meet the requirement of 2 prior publication cycles as STU?</p>

<p>where is that requirement?</p>

<p>FMM5 for FHIR says "PLUS the artifact has been published in two formal publication release cycles at FMM1+ (i.e. Trial Use level) and has been implemented in at least 5 independent production systems in more than one country".  While FHIRPath doesn't <em>have</em> to adhere to FHIR's FMM requirements, I think the organization has identified the notion of maturity levels as "good practice" and given the high level of dependency FHIR has on FHIRPath, I would hope that we would maintain that same level of rigor and process.  The notion of 2 STU publication cycles is to ensure that the artifact has had sufficiently wide and deep penetration that we feel safe locking it down.  I don't see a dependency where FHIRPath would have to be normative in order for StructureDefinition to be normative, so I'm not sure there's a rush.</p>
