If it is mainly for features I think we should stick to emailing <a href=\"mailto:webmaster@hl7.org\" title=\"mailto:webmaster@hl7.org\">webmaster@hl7.org</a> because 1. it simplifies the process instead of create another approval process or repository 2. i think the tendency of confused people to request things that already exist will pile sky high if we provide them a golden path to do so. Just thoughts.. Let me know what you think.</p>",
