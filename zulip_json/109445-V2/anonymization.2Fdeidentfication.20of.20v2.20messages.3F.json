Add onto that that v2 systems are notorious for not populating segments consistently plus frequent reliance on Z-segments for important information, I think you'll be hard-pressed to find a generic tooling solution.</p>",

Note, that all de-identification is a process that is specific to the data you have and the intended use of the resulting de-identified data. This process would look to the content of each element (e.g. each z-segment), and the need for the data to be maintained.  see my article on this <a href=\"https://healthcaresecprivacy.blogspot.com/2015/02/is-it-really-possible-to-anonymize-data.html\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://healthcaresecprivacy.blogspot.com/2015/02/is-it-really-possible-to-anonymize-data.html\">https://healthcaresecprivacy.blogspot.com/2015/02/is-it-really-possible-to-anonymize-data.html</a></p>",
