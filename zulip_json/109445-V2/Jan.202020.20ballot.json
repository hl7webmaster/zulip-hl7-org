One is for Early Hearing Detection and Intervention (EHDI) and the other is for Critical Congenital Heart Defects (CCHD). Both use ORU^R01 messages to report newborn screening results to a public health agency or EHR. As well, proposed quality criteria guidelines for both the v2 base standard and v2 IGs are up for ballot. These proposed guidelines outline requirements and best practices for v2 products. If you're interested, please be sure to sign up before the ballot period opens. Thanks.</p>",
