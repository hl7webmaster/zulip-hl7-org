Genomics consists of the Sequence resource and several profiles built on top of existing FHIR resources (DiagnosticReport-genetics profile, DiagnosticOrder-genetics profile, Observation-genetics profile). The Sequence resource is a core resource in FHIR Genomics. It is used to represent complex genetics data. FHIR Genomics focuses on clinical genetics data reporting.<br>\nWe will also look to compare current FHIR extension model with a component-based model.
