Be a part of an exciting new way to learn about and continuously improve adoption of C-CDA.</p>\n<p>FHIR Connectathon includes an exciting new track!!  The CCDA Implementation-A-Thon (C-CDA IAT) is now being held in conjunction with the FHIR Connectathon.  The CCDA IAT helps implementers work to reduce inconsistencies in HL7 C-CDA® implementations across the healthcare industry. The track also includes collaboration aimed at clarifying C-CDA document creation questions and exploratory sessions designed to bring clarity for less defined or emerging data representation in C-CDA.  </p>\n<p>Registration for the C-CDA IAT Track allows participants to optimize their participation across CDA and FHIR related Tracks. You can participate in  the structured CCDA IAT track activities that suit your needs and interests, or take time out to participate in other aspects of the FHIR Connectathon.  With the FHIR Connectathon happening at the same time, CDA implementers gain the opportunity to test crossover functionality like the FHIR Conversion Challenge (C-CDA to C-CDA on FHIR bidirectional document conversion).</p>\n<p>The CDA IAT Track agenda is broken out by 90 minute quarters.  This will facilitate your ability to focus on just the CCDA topics of interest to you and your organization.  Of course, if they are all of interest, you can participate in all eight quarters. In addition to the C-CDA on FHIR and attachments quarter, the CDA IAT Track will include quarters on Data Provenance, Care Plan Documents, USCDI (US Core Data for Interoperability) and will cover review of the the evolving ONC Scorecard Rubric. It also includes pre-Connectathon virtual working sessions to introduce each topic and focus participants on getting the most out of their hands-on time in January. This track is ideal  for CDA Implementers interested in gaining exposure to FHIR and the possibilities for harnessing both. The timing also makes it ideal for gaining exposure to CDA and FHIR prior to attending the Payor Summit.</p>",
