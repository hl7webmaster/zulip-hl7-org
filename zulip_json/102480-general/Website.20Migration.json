Or, you can use per-application settings to specify mappings specific to this application by specifying a mappings struct to THIS.mappings in Application.cfc.<br>\nUsing relative paths (for example, template=\"index.cfm\" or template=\"../index.cfm\") does not require the creation of any special mappings.
