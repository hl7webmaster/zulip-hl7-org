        "content": "<p>\"Should be\" and \"is\" are not necessarily the same.  As Elliot says, a lot of v2 systems don't do queries at all.  HL7 only defines standard queries where the community has asked us to do so.  There are no standard queries defined in the radiology space.  If you need one, you're going to have to define one of your own.  Chapter 5 explains how to do that.  The good news is that your communication partner has said they'll do whatever you tell them to - so define a query that takes the parameters you need and returns the data you need and you're good to go.  Just don't expect anyone that you haven't specifically negotiated with to support it.</p>",

Doing a review of a draft specification (or even a draft instance) to make sure it's valid is the sort of thing you'd probably need to pay someone to do if you can't do it yourself.
