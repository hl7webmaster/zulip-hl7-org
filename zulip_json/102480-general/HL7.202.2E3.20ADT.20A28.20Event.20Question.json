However, a \"pseudo-optional\" PV1 can be achieved by valuing PV1-2 - Patient Class to N - not applicable.\"</p>\n<p>This is confirmed by the lack of square brackets [ ] around the PV1 segment in the message definition table for the A28 message. Compare PD1 (which is optional) to PV1 (which is not optional) in the message definition to see the difference.</p>\n<p>So PV1 is required, but may not contain any relevant information (although you should always check with your trading partners (if they are the source of the ADT message) to understand how they might be populating that segment (they may not use the \"pseudo-optional\" PV1 and may be putting important information in the segment).</p>\n<p><span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"116961\">@Alexander de Leon</span>  should be able to confirm this.</p>",
