Are you talking about 2 different versions of the VIS or the fact that a given vaccine might have a specific VIS but then also be covered in the multi-vaccine VIS? Either way, has the patient been given both VIS or just one? The HL7 message should only reflect what the patient was actually given, not what might have been available at the time.</p>",

The case I am referring to is the latter \" given vaccine might have a specific VIS but then also be covered in the multi-vaccine VIS\". If the patient was indeed handed both (I am not sure how realistic this scenario is), then do we send 2 OBX segments with VIS Published date for a single vaccine?</p>",

        "content": "<p>I checked with a few colleagues (just to make sure we had the right answer) and the consensus is that while it wouldn't be technically wrong to send both VIS, we don't think that is what most systems would expect to receive (and so we don't recommend it).  We agree that this is an unlikely scenario, but should it happen, it would be sufficient to send the document ID and publication date for just a one of the two VIS. Either the vaccine specific VIS could be sent or the multi-vaccine VIS (provided that 2 or more vaccines from the multi-vaccine VIS were administered at that visit - the CDC VIS site (<a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/hcp/vis/current-vis.html\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/hcp/vis/current-vis.html\">https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/hcp/vis/current-vis.html</a>) indicates that the multi-vaccine VIS can be used when 2 or more of the vaccines are administered at the same time). As I mentioned before, the critical thing is that the VIS in the message reflects what the patient was actually given. Hope that helps. Let me know if you have other questions.</p>",
