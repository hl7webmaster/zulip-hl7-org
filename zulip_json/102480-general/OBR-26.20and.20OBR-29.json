For example, a positive bacterial culture result (eg. urine culture that resulted in a bacterial isolate being found) could be the parent to the antibiotic susceptibility testing on that isolate. In this case the susceptibility result message will use OBR-26 and -29 to point back to the \"parent\" culture result. Reflex tests can also use these fields to link the reflex result to the original parent result.</p>",
