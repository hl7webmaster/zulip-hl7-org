This is an opportunity for students to learn about HL7, its legacy standards and FHIR. A major focus of this presentation will be an overview of our most recent standard FHIR and how a knowledge of HL7 standards will give these students a competitive edge in the job market. Registration is required, and students can register for this free tutorial at: <a href=\"https://lnkd.in/eMikQVy\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://lnkd.in/eMikQVy\">https://lnkd.in/eMikQVy</a>.
