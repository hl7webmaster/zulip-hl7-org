I hope it helps <a href=\"https://www.fda.gov/consumers/consumer-updates/it-really-fda-approved\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://www.fda.gov/consumers/consumer-updates/it-really-fda-approved\">https://www.fda.gov/consumers/consumer-updates/it-really-fda-approved</a>. I did a bit of research, I was not able to find anything related to FDA approvals for software integration. I believe they may need HIPPA approval if staff interacts and has access to identifiable medical record, however if its only data without identifiable medical information they may not require HIPPA compliance. Let me know your thoughts :) thanks for posting this question.</p>",
