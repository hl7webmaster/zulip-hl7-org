Looking at a guide like CCDA or the IHE CDA specs with highly structured templates, one would assume those to be 100% DRIV as well. epSOS, Trillium Bridge etc: 100% DRIV.</p>\n<p>So I'm a bit curious as to why a group of (mainly US) CDA experts would claim most implementations to be COMP rather than DRIV. What's the reason for making such a statement?</p>",
