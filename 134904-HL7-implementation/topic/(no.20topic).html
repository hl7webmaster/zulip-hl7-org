<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="226436">@Samba Chennamsetty</span>  You should post this in a proper stream - HL7 Implementation at the minimum.  You also need to determine which HL7 specification your "message" is and then you can ask your question on an even more relevant stream.  Please look at the HL7 webpage and determine if you have V2, V3, CDA, or FHIR.</p>
