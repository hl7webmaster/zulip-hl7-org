<p>I need to make reference to HL7 as part of a manuscript in which I describe having a software program create an HL7 message with patient information that is then sent to an electronic health record.</p>
<p>Can anyone recommend any published HL7 references describing HL7 background/foundation or its general use in healthcare that would serve as an appropriate reference for a journal manuscript?  I would like to reference 1-2 articles that provide an overview of HL7 for that purpose, but it's hard finding one that is really just an overview of HL7 with its past and current use.</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="148855">@Fahd ahmad</span> You can use any material from the website and just state that the information was obtained from <a href="http://HL7.org" target="_blank" title="http://HL7.org">HL7.org</a>.  There are a lot of trade journals that write about HL7 but that may not suit your needs.  Also, there are HL7 books available through the store (links to Amazon).  For a general introduction to HL7, you may try <a href="http://www.hl7.org/newsroom/HL7backgrounderbrief.cfm" target="_blank" title="http://www.hl7.org/newsroom/HL7backgrounderbrief.cfm">http://www.hl7.org/newsroom/HL7backgrounderbrief.cfm</a>.</p>
