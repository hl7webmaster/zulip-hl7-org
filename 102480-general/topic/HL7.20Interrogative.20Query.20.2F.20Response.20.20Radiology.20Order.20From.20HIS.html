Request:<br>
For Example:-<br>
Request:-<br>
--&gt; Sample Request Message<br>
 MSH Segment, MSH-9 Field for Pharmacy Query QRY^Q26 (I am looking this field for Radiology Order Query)<br>
QRD Segment will send about Patient MRN and Order Type</p>
<p>Response:<br>
Sample Response message for all the Radiology Orders<br>
For Example: <br>
(MSH-9 Field)<br>
PID Segment<br>
ORC (I am not sure)<br>

<p>Unfortunately the team told us you send us the HL7 specification we will prepare accordingly. Due to this I am looking for it.</p>

<p>I’ve never heard of someone doing this; systems that I’m aware of simply listen for the orders and keep a record. </p>
<p>The original question seems to suggest that there is a pharmacy-specific way of doing this, and by extension expects a radiology-specific variant. I’m not sure this is true. </p>

<p>Thanks For reply.<br>
But there should be some way to get all orders (Pharmacy, Lab &amp; Radiology) for a specific patient by Patient ID or MRN. Pharmacy example i present here because I got this easily and provide them the HL7 specification they implemented and its working fine. Request Message QRY^Q26 with QRD Segment. Response Message: ROR^ROR With ORC and RXC Segment.</p>
<p><strong>Alternate Is: </strong>Can you please specify the trigger Message for Radiology Orders?  So in this case when patient have any order  (New, change or cancel)   we receive message.</p>

<p>"Should be" and "is" are not necessarily the same.  As Elliot says, a lot of v2 systems don't do queries at all.  HL7 only defines standard queries where the community has asked us to do so.  There are no standard queries defined in the radiology space.  If you need one, you're going to have to define one of your own.  Chapter 5 explains how to do that.  The good news is that your communication partner has said they'll do whatever you tell them to - so define a query that takes the parameters you need and returns the data you need and you're good to go.  Just don't expect anyone that you haven't specifically negotiated with to support it.</p>

<p>O23 is the trigger for radiology orders.  You'll need to look at all of the other triggers for changes though.  Those can all be found in the HL7 spec.</p>

<p>Have you read chapter 5 of the specification about creating custom queries?  The segments can be whatever ones you find useful - which will depend on your business case.  You can take a look at the radiology message structures to see which ones could theoretically be present in a notification and subset from there.</p>

<p>Before After Long struggle I provide them HL7 specification for two interfaces  1. Patient Demographic Information 2. Pharmacy Orders<br>
3. Now I am looking for radiology Orders, I though from here I can find quick solution.<br>
Can you provide the URL for so I can download HL7 chapter 5.<br>

<p>That's not really the purpose of this discussion forum.  You're free to ask quick questions that other members of the community (i.e. volunteers) who might have past experience that allows them to give you a quick answer.  However, no one here is paid.  Doing a review of a draft specification (or even a draft instance) to make sure it's valid is the sort of thing you'd probably need to pay someone to do if you can't do it yourself.  (That said, tha bare ORC and OBRs look odd - normally if you have nothing to send for a segment you omit it.  Also, I think you're missing at least some required elements.  Make sure you read through the spec for every segment and data type you're sending.</p>

<p>Yes I checked. <br>
<strong>ORC </strong>Common Order, Which is required. <strong>TQ1 </strong>(Timing / Quantity) also required. <strong>OBR </strong>-- Observation Request. <br>
Is segments are OK?, and OBR is repeatable?</p>
<p>Remaining Segment definition  / detail i will check from spec. This is Understandable for me.</p>
