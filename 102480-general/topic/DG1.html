<p>Is the DG1 segment mainly used as a billing code?  Are ICD10 codes used to code for billing purposes mainly or do physicians use to actually have that ICD code serve as the diagnosis of the illness and that code is used for medical purposes, not so much as billing?  Do EHR systms have the DG1 in their billing module?</p>
